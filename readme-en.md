# Data-Structures

WARNING: 

This data structures implementation was realized for educational purpose. Therefore, its use is not recommended for personal applications/projects because of possible bugs.

Notions are taught at the data structures course at the University of Salerno by Professor Maurizio Tucci.
The code is partially present in Professor Ivan Visconti's booklets and was revisited and commented by me.

I suggest the code for studying the data structures basics.
